= Tasks to do

* [ ] Update algorithms to use new algorithm name spaces
* [ ] Code tab incorrectly showing value for concurrency and missing node label & relationship type
* [ ] Code tab not handling nested Cypher maps properly (putting all keys inside double quotes, which is invalid Cypher syntax)
* [ ] Auto fill available properties based on the output of `db.schema.relTypeProperties()`
* [ ] Make a component of the relationship type - relationship orientation - weight property trio
* [ ] Add tests around parameter construction in queries.js
* [ ] Tidy up code in parameter construction/remove duplication
* [x] Handle directions for relationship types
* [x] Move node labels and relationship types into config map
* [x] Code tab missing node label & relationship type
