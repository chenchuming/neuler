= Tasks to do

* [ ] Update algorithms to use new algorithm name spaces
* [ ] Move node labels and relationship types into config map

* [ ] Code tab incorrectly showing value for concurrency and missing node label & relationship type
* [ ] Code tab not handling nested Cypher maps properly (putting all keys inside double quotes, which is invalid Cypher syntax)
* [x] Code tab missing node label & relationship type
